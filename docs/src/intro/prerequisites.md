# Prerequisites

To successfully implement the kernels in Mini-YAIE, you should be familiar with:

## Programming Languages

- **Python (Intermediate)**: Understanding of classes, inheritance, type hinting, and PyTorch tensors.
- **C++ (Basic)**: For reading and writing the CUDA kernels (though much of the boilerplate is provided).
- **CUDA (Basic)**: Understanding of the GPU execution model (blocks, threads, shared memory).

## Machine Learning Concepts

- **Transformer Architecture**: Queries, Keys, Values, Attention mechanism.
- **Tensors**: Shapes, dimensions, matrix multiplication.

## Tools

- **Git**: For version control.
- **Linux/Unix Shell**: For running commands.
